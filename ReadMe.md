# MOOC Drop-out Prediction
### Problem Statement
> Students' high dropout rate on MOOC platforms has been heavily criticized, and predicting their likelihood of dropout would be useful for maintaining and encouraging students' learning activities

### Structure

Proj_4472_T1_Group6_code.zip 

   1. *preprocessing_eventcount.py* 
      - Pre-processes  1st Feature Vector : Events Count 
      - Includes load data and produces Feature Table in CSV.

   2. *preprocessing_daycount.py* 
      - Pre-processes  2nd Feature Vector : Day Count 
      - Includes load data and produces Feature Table in CSV.

   3. *preprocessing_combined.py*  
      - Pre-processes -> Combines both Feature Vectors 
      - Reads directly from CSV’s produced in a. and b.
      - Produces final Feature Table in CSV.

   4. *Rf.py* 
      - Classifier #1 -> Outputs a .txt file and ROC curves

   5. *mlp.py* 
      - Classifier #2 -> Outputs a .txt file and ROC curves

   6. *xgb.py* 
      - Classifier #3 -> Outputs a .txt file and ROC curves.

   7. *hard_voting.py*  
      - Calls Ensemble method

   8. *dataset (folder)* 
      - Contains all the data provided by XueTang.
      - Contains a "feature" folder that stores the CSV's produced in a, b, and c.

   9. *outputs (folder)* 
      - Contains all .txt files produced in d, e, and f.
      - Contains the ROC curves that are to be manually saved as PNG's.
